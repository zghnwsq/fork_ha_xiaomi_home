## Security

Xiaomi Home Integration and the affiliated cloud interface is provided by Xiaomi officially. You need to use your Xiaomi account to login to get your device list. Xiaomi Home Integration implements OAuth 2.0 login process, which does not keep your account password in the Home Assistant application. However, due to the limitation of the Home Assistant platform, the user information (including device information, certificates, tokens, etc.) of your Xiaomi account will be saved in the Home Assistant configuration file in clear text after successful login. You need to ensure that your Home Assistant configuration file is properly stored. The exposure of your configuration file may result in others logging in with your identity.

> If you suspect that your OAuth 2.0 token has been leaked, you can revoke the login authorization of your Xiaomi account by the following steps: Xiaomi Home APP -> Profile -> Click your username and get into Xiaomi Account management page -> Basic info: Apps -> Xiaomi Home (Home Assistant Integration) -> Remove

## FAQ

- Does Xiaomi Home Integration support all Xiaomi smart devices?

  Xiaomi Home Integration currently supports most categories of the smart device. Only a few categories are not supported. They are Bluetooth device, infrared device and virtual device.

- Does Xiaomi Home Integration support multiple Xiaomi accounts?

  Yes, it supports multiple Xiaomi accounts. Furthermore, Xiaomi Home Integration allows that devices belonging to different accounts can be added to a same area.

- Does Xiaomi Home Integration support local control?

  Local control is implemented by [Xiaomi Central Hub Gateway](https://www.mi.com/shop/buy/detail?product_id=15755&cfrom=search) (firmware version 3.3.0_0023 and above) or Xiaomi smart devices with built-in central hub gateway (software version 0.8.9 and above) inside. If you do not have a Xiaomi central hub gateway or other devices having central hub gateway function, all control commands are sent through Xiaomi Cloud. The firmware for Xiaomi central hub gateway including the built-in central hub gateway supporting Home Assistant local control feature has not been released yet. Please refer to MIoT team's notification for upgrade plans.

  Xiaomi central hub gateway is only available in mainland China. In other regions, it is not available.

  Xiaomi Home Integration can also implement partial local control by enabling Xiaomi LAN control function. Xiaomi LAN control function can only control IP devices (devices connected to the router via WiFi or ethernet cable) in the same local area network as Home Assistant. It cannot control BLE Mesh, ZigBee, etc. devices. This function may cause some abnormalities. We recommend not to use this function. Xiaomi LAN control function is enabled by [Settings > Devices & services > Configured > Xiaomi Home](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=xiaomi_home) > CONFIGURE > Update LAN control configuration

  Xiaomi LAN control function is not restricted by region. It is available in all regions. However, if there is a central gateway in the local area network where Home Assistant is located, even Xiaomi LAN control function is enabled in the integration, it will not take effect.

- In which regions is Xiaomi Home Integration available?

  Xiaomi Home Integration can be used in the mainland of China, Europe, India, Russia, Singapore, and USA. As user data in Xiaomi Cloud of different regions is isolated, you need to choose your region when importing MIoT devices in the configuration process. Xiaomi Home Integration allows you to import devices of different regions to a same area.

## Principle of Messaging

### Control through the Cloud

<div align=center>
<img src="./doc/images/cloud_control.jpg" width=300>

Image 1: Cloud control architecture

 </div>

Xiaomi Home Integration subscribes to the interested device messages on the MQTT Broker in MIoT Cloud. When a device property changes or a device event occurs, the device sends an upstream message to MIoT Cloud, and the MQTT Broker pushes the subscribed device message to Xiaomi Home Integration. Because Xiaomi Home Integration does not need to poll to obtain the current device property value in the cloud, it can immediately receive the notification message when the properties change or the events occur. Thanks to the message subscription mechanism, Xiaomi Home Integration only queries the properties of all devices from the cloud once when the integration configuration is completed, which puts little access pressure on the cloud.

Xiaomi Home Integration sends command messages to the devices via the HTTP interface of MIoT Cloud to control devices. The device reacts and responds after receiving the downstream message sent forward by MIoT Cloud.

### Control locally

<div align=center>
<img src="./doc/images/local_control.jpg" width=300>

Image 2: Local control architecture

</div>

Xiaomi central hub gateway contains a standard MQTT Broker, which implements a complete subscribe-publish mechanism. Xiaomi Home Integration subscribes to the interested device messages through Xiaomi central hub gateway. When a device property changes or a device event occurs, the device sends an upstream message to Xiaomi central hub gateway, and the MQTT Broker pushes the subscribed device message to Xiaomi Home Integration.

When Xiaomi Home Integration needs to control a device, it publishes a device command message to the MQTT Broker, which is then forwarded to the device by Xiaomi central hub gateway. The device reacts and responds after receiving the downstream message from the gateway.

## Mapping Relationship between MIoT-Spec-V2 and Home Assistant Entity

[MIoT-Spec-V2](https://iot.mi.com/v2/new/doc/introduction/knowledge/spec) is the abbreviation for MIoT Specification Version 2, which is an IoT protocol formulated by Xiaomi IoT platform to give a standard functional description of IoT devices. It includes function definition (referred to as data model by other IoT platforms), interaction model, message format, and encoding.

In MIoT-Spec-V2 protocol, a product is defined as a device. A device contains several services. A service may have some properties, events and actions. Xiaomi Home Integration creates Home Assistant entities according to MIoT-Spec-V2. The conversion relationship is as follows.

### General Conversion

- Property

| access       | format                | value-list   | value-range | Entity in Home Assistant |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| writable     | string                | -            | -           | Text                     |
| writable     | bool                  | -            | -           | Switch                   |
| writable     | not string & not bool | existent     | -           | Select                   |
| writable     | not string & not bool | non-existent | existent    | Number                   |
| not writable | -                     | -            | -           | Sensor                   |

- Event

MIoT-Spec-V2 event is transformed to Event entity in Home Assistant. The event's parameters are also passed to entity's `_trigger_event`.

MIoT-Spec-V2 event's arguments field is the list of parameters of the event. The list elements represent the piid of the property in the same service. For example, the [MIoT-Spec-V2](http://poc.miot-spec.srv/miot-spec-v2/instance?type=urn:miot-spec-v2:device:remote-control:0000A021:xiaomi-mcn002:1:0000D057) of the Xiaomi Wireless Double-key Switch contains the siid=2 Switch Sensor service. The eiid=1014 Long Press event of the service is triggered when a button is long pressed. The debug level log will print `Press and hold, attributes: {'Button Type': 1}`. This is an example log that the button type is 1, which means the right button is long pressed.

- Action

| in        | Entity in Home Assistant |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| empty     | Button                   |
| not empty | Notify                   |

If the debug mode for action is activated, the Text entity will be created when the "in" field in the action spec is not empty.

The "Attribute" item in the entity details page displays the format of the input parameter which is an ordered list, enclosed in square brackets []. The string elements in the list are enclosed in double quotation marks "".

For example, the "Attributes" item in the details page of the Notify entity converted by the "Intelligent Speaker Execute Text Directive" action of xiaomi.wifispeaker.s12 siid=5, aiid=5 instance shows the action params as `[Text Content(str), Silent Execution(bool)]`. A properly formatted input is `["Hello", true]`.

### Specific Conversion

MIoT-Spec-V2 uses URN for defining types. The format is `urn:<namespace>:<type>:<name>:<value>[:<vendor-product>:<version>]`, in which `name` is a human-readable word or phrase describing the instance of device, service, property, event and action. Xiaomi Home Integration first determines whether to convert the MIoT-Spec-V2 instance into a specific Home Assistant entity based on the instance's name. For the instance that does not meet the specific conversion rules, general conversion rules are used for conversion.

`namespace` is the namespace of MIoT-Spec-V2 instance. When its value is miot-spec-v2, it means that the specification is defined by Xiaomi. When its value is bluetooth-spec, it means that the specification is defined by Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). When its value is not miot-spec-v2 or bluetooth-spec, it means that the specification is defined by other vendors. If MIoT-Spec-V2 `namespace` is not miot-spec-v2, a star mark `*` is added in front of the entity's name .

- Device

The conversion follows `SPEC_DEVICE_TRANS_MAP`.

```
{
    '<device instance name>':{
        'required':{
            '<service instance name>':{
                'required':{
                    'properties': {
                        '<property instance name>': set<property access: str>
                    },
                    'events': set<event instance name: str>,
                    'actions': set<action instance name: str>
                },
                'optional':{
                    'properties': set<property instance name: str>,
                    'events': set<event instance name: str>,
                    'actions': set<action instance name: str>
                }
            }
        },
        'optional':{
            '<service instance name>':{
                'required':{
                    'properties': {
                        '<property instance name>': set<property access: str>
                    },
                    'events': set<event instance name: str>,
                    'actions': set<action instance name: str>
                },
                'optional':{
                    'properties': set<property instance name: str>,
                    'events': set<event instance name: str>,
                    'actions': set<action instance name: str>
                }
            }
        },
        'entity': str
    }
}
```

The "required" field under "device instance name" indicates the required services of the device. The "optional" field under "device instance name" indicates the optional services of the device. The "entity" field indicates the Home Assistant entity to be created. The "required" and the "optional" field under "service instance name" are required and optional properties, events and actions of the service respectively. The value of "property instance name" under "required" "properties" field is the access mode of the property. The condition for a successful match is that the value of "property instance name" is a subset of the access mode of the corresponding MIoT-Spec-V2 property instance.

Home Assistant entity will not be created if MIoT-Spec-V2 device instance does not contain all required services, properties, events or actions.

- Service

The conversion follows `SPEC_SERVICE_TRANS_MAP`.

```
{
    '<service instance name>':{
        'required':{
            'properties': {
                '<property instance name>': set<property access: str>
            },
            'events': set<event instance name: str>,
            'actions': set<action instance name: str>
        },
        'optional':{
            'properties': set<property instance name: str>,
            'events': set<event instance name: str>,
            'actions': set<action instance name: str>
        },
        'entity': str
    }
}
```

The "required" field under "service instance name" indicates the required properties, events and actions of the service. The "optional" field indicates the optional properties, events and actions of the service. The "entity" field indicates the Home Assistant entity to be created. The value of "property instance name" under "required" "properties" field is the access mode of the property. The condition for a successful match is that the value of "property instance name" is a subset of the access mode of the corresponding MIoT-Spec-V2 property instance.

Home Assistant entity will not be created if MIoT-Spec-V2 service instance does not contain all required properties, events or actions.

- Property

The conversion follows `SPEC_PROP_TRANS_MAP`.

```
{
    'entities':{
        '<entity name>':{
            'format': set<str>,
            'access': set<str>
        }
    },
    'properties': {
        '<property instance name>':{
            'device_class': str,
            'entity': str
        }
    }
}
```

The "format" field under "entity name" represents the data format of the property, and matching with one value indicates a successful match. The "access" field under "entity name" represents the access mode of the property, and matching with all values is considered a successful match.

The "entity" field under "property instance name", of which value is one of entity name under "entities" field, indicates the Home Assistant entity to be created. The "device_class" field under "property instance name" indicates the Home Assistant entity's `_attr_device_class`.

- Event

The conversion follows `SPEC_EVENT_TRANS_MAP`.

```
{
    '<event instance name>': str
}
```

The value of the event instance name indicates `_attr_device_class` of the Home Assistant entity to be created.

### MIoT-Spec-V2 Filter

`spec_filter.yaml` is used to filter out the MIoT-Spec-V2 instance that will not be converted to Home Assistant entity.

The format of `spec_filter.yaml` is as follows.

```yaml
<MIoT-Spec-V2 device instance urn without the version field>:
    services: list<service_iid: str>
    properties: list<service_iid.property_iid: str>
    events: list<service_iid.event_iid: str>
    actions: list<service_iid.action_iid: str>
```

The key of `spec_filter.yaml` dictionary is the urn excluding the "version" field of the MIoT-Spec-V2 device instance. The firmware of different versions of the same product may be associated with the MIoT-Spec-V2 device instances of different versions. It is required that the MIoT-Spec-V2 instance of a higher version must contain all MIoT-Spec-V2 instances of the lower versions when a vendor defines the MIoT-Spec-V2 of its product on MIoT platform. Thus, the key of `spec_filter.yaml` does not need to specify the version number of MIoT-Spec-V2 device instance.

The value of "services", "properties", "events" or "actions" fields under "device instance" is the instance id (iid) of the service, property, event or action that will be ignored in the conversion process. Wildcard matching is supported.

Example:

```yaml
urn:miot-spec-v2:device:television:0000A010:xiaomi-rmi1:
    services:
    - '*'   # Filter out all services. It is equivalent to completely ignoring the device with such MIoT-Spec-V2.
urn:miot-spec-v2:device:gateway:0000A019:xiaomi-hub1:
    services:
    - '3'   # Filter out the siid=3 service.
    properties:
    - '4.*' # Filter out all properties in the siid=4 service.
    events:
    - '4.1' # Filter out the eiid=1 event in the siid=4 service.
    actions:
    - '4.1' # Filter out the aiid=1 action in the siid=4 service.
```

Device information service (urn:miot-spec-v2:service:device-information:00007801) of all devices will never be converted to Home Assistant entity.

## Multiple Language Support

There are 8 languages available for selection in the config flow language option of Xiaomi Home, including Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English, Spanish, Russian, French, German, and Japanese. The config flow page in Simplified Chinese and English has been manually reviewed by the developer. Other languages are translated by machine translation. If you want to modify the words and sentences in the config flow page, you need to modify the json file of the certain language in `custom_components/xiaomi_home/translations/` and `custom_components/xiaomi_home/miot/i18n/` directory.

When displaying Home Assistant entity name, Xiaomi Home downloads the multiple language file configured by the device vendor from MIoT Cloud, which contains translations for MIoT-Spec-V2 instances of the device. `multi_lang.json` is a locally maintained multiple language dictionary, which has a higher priority than the multiple language file obtained from the cloud and can be used to supplement or modify the multiple language translation of devices.

The format of `multi_lang.json` is as follows.

```
{
    "<MIoT-Spec-V2 device instance>": {
        "<language code>": {
            "<instance code>": <translation: str>
        }
    }
}
```

The key of `multi_lang.json` dictionary is the urn excluding the "version" field of the MIoT-Spec-V2 device instance.

The language code is zh-Hans, zh-Hant, en, es, ru, fr, de, or ja, corresponding to the 8 selectable languages mentioned above.

The instance code is the code of the MIoT-Spec-V2 instance, which is in the format of:

```
service:<siid>                  # service
service:<siid>:property:<piid>  # property
service:<siid>:property:<piid>:valuelist:<index> # The index of a value in the value-list of a property
service:<siid>:event:<eiid>     # event
service:<siid>:action:<aiid>    # action
```

siid, piid, eiid, aiid and value are all decimal three-digit integers.

Example:

```
{
    "urn:miot-spec-v2:device:health-pot:0000A051:chunmi-a1": {
        "zh-Hant": {
            "service:002": "養生壺",
            "service:002:property:001": "工作狀態",
            "service:002:property:001:valuelist:000": "待機中",
            "service:002:action:002": "停止烹飪",
            "service:005:event:001": "烹飪完成"
        }
    }
}
```

> If you edit any files in the `custom_components/xiaomi_home/miot/specs` directory (`spec_filter.yaml`, `spec_modify.yaml`, `multi_lang.json`, etc.) in your Home Assistant, you need to update the entity conversion rule in the integration's CONFIGURE page to take effect. Method: [Settings > Devices & services > Configured > Xiaomi Home](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=xiaomi_home) > CONFIGURE > Update entity conversion rules
